# Translating habitat modelling for caribou conservation with indegenous insights


## Introduction

In partnership with the Biigtigong First Nation, this project aims to create an inclusive and practical habitat management plan for caribou conservation in Slate Islands Provincial Park over the next five years. The initiative focuses on improving understanding of caribou habitat dynamics and their future changes, promoting active Indigenous involvement and leadership in conservation, and ensuring the protection of the caribou population, currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

**Project Background**

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains a comprehensive list assessing the status of all known species, categorizing them from "Least Concern" to "Extinct." The caribou is classified as "Vulnerable" on this list. Within Lake Superior lies a group of islands known as the Slate Islands, which once supported a thriving population of caribou. However, these animals were completely extirpated from the area in 1993. The Slate Islands are part of the traditional territory of the Biigtigong First Nation and are crucial to the conservation of caribou.

Efforts to reintroduce caribou to the Slate Islands are underway, with a small number of individuals already introduced. However, two critical challenges remain:
  * The nature of the habitat, including its historical changes and projected evolution, which are essential to caribou survival, is poorly understood.
  * Conventional approaches to address these challenges rely heavily on scientific methods, such as remote sensing technology, which limit inclusiveness and fail to integrate the knowledge of the Indigenous communities that own the Slate Islands.

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between Indigenous knowledge and scientific understanding, including remote sensing technology, to develop effective conservation strategies for the caribou on the Slate Islands.
