# Translating habitat modelling for caribou conservation with indegenous insights


## Introduction

In partnership with the Biigtigong First Nation, this project aims to create an inclusive and practical habitat management plan for caribou conservation in Slate Islands Provincial Park over the next five years. The initiative focuses on improving understanding of caribou habitat dynamics and their future changes, promoting active Indigenous involvement and leadership in conservation, and ensuring the protection of the caribou population, currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
